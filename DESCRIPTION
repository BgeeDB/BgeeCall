Description: Reference intergenic regions are generated by the Bgee RNA-Seq pipeliene. These intergenic regions are used 
    to generate all Bgee RNA-Seq present/absent expression calls. This package now allows to generate your own present/absent 
    calls using both these intergenic regions and the expertise of Bgee, as long as your species is present in Bgee. The 
    threshold of present/absent expression is no longer arbitrary defined but is calculated based on expression of all RNA-Seq 
    libraries integrated in Bgee.
