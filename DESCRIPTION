Version: 1.7.6

	c(person("Julien", "Wollbrett", 
		role = c("aut", "cre"), 
		email = "julien.wollbrett@unil.ch"),
    person("Sara", "Fonseca Costa", role = "aut"),

Description: BgeeCall allows to generate present/absent gene expression calls without using an arbitrary cutoff like TPM<1. 
    Calls are generated based on reference intergenic sequences. These sequences are generated based on expression of all RNA-Seq 
    libraries of each species integrated in Bgee (https://bgee.org).
