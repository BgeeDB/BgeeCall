Description: BgeeCall allows to generate present/absent gene expression calls without using an arbitrary cutoff like TPM<1. 
    Calls are generated based on reference intergenic sequences. These sequences are generated based on expression of all RNA-Seq 
    libraries of each species integrated in Bgee (https://bgee.org).
