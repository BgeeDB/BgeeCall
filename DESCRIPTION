Description: Reference intergenic regions are generated by the Bgee RNA-Seq pipeline. These intergenic regions are used 
    to generate all Bgee RNA-Seq present/absent expression calls. BgeeCall now allows to generate present/absent 
    calls for any RNA-Seq library as long as reference intergenic sequences have been generated for the corresponding species. The 
    threshold of present/absent expression is no longer arbitrary defined but is calculated based on expression of all RNA-Seq 
    libraries integrated in Bgee.
