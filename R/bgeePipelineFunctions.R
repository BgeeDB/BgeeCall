#' This cutoff will correspond to the minimal value of TPM for which the ratio
#' of genes and intergenic regions is equal to `intergenic_cutoff`
#' (by default = 0.05)
#' or lower (first test if at least 1 TPM value has this property):
#'
#' @param counts TPM information for both genic and intergenic regions
#' @param selected_coding TPM information for both protein_coding regions
#' @param selected_intergenic TPM information for intergenic regions
#' @param intergenic_cutoff value of the ratio between prop of
#' intergenic present and protein coding present (called r in this function)
#'
#' @return the TPM cutoff and the value of r (proportion of intergenic regions
